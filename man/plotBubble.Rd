\arguments{
\item{results}{data.table from simulateGrid.}

\item{rbp_x}{Name of first RBP (one half of split dot).}

\item{rbp_y}{Name of second RBP (other half of split dot).}

\item{roi_range}{Numeric vector (start, end) for region of interest.}

\item{rna_conc}{RNA concentration to filter.}

\item{protein_conc}{Named numeric vector to filter other protein concentrations.
e.g., c(HH=100, HL=100) to fix HH and HL at 100nM while varying rbp_x and rbp_y.}

\item{metric}{"occupancy", "density", "density_fc", or "occupancy_fc".}

\item{scale_factor}{Scaling factor for bubble size (default 0.4).}

\item{colors}{Named vector of colors for the RBPs.}

\item{legend_breaks}{Numeric vector of values to show in size legend.
If NULL, shows 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of max value.}

\description{
Visualizes competitive binding between two RBPs using split-dot bubbles.
Each grid point is a dot split diagonally, with one side (RBP X) and 
the other side (RBP Y) sized by their respective metric values.
